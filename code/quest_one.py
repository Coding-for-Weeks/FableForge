    print("A chilling wind sweeps through the bustling market of Lyrinhold, carrying with it an eerie melody that only a few can\nhear. Among them, you. The haunting tune is accompanied by faint whispers in a language you don’t understand—yet\nsomehow, you feel they’re meant for you. Rumors speak of an ancient crystal shard, hidden deep within the cursed ruins of Eldrath. They say it holds the power to shape reality itself but comes with a price too steep for most to bear.")
    print("\nAs the whispers grow louder, a hooded figure approaches, their voice a rasp. “You’ve heard it, haven’t you? The shard\ncalls to you. But beware... the ones who seek it will stop at nothing.” With that, they vanish into the crowd, leaving you with only the choice to follow the melody—or ignore it and let the whispers drive you mad.")
